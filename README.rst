=========

pydivvy is a little tool that helps you to divide your screen into equal segments and assign them to your applications. You just click on the tkinter-based GUI, drag, let go and select the application to move and resize.

pydivvy is inspired by an app for Macs: Divvy_.

Under the hood, pydivvy uses wmctrl_, so it should work with any EWMH compatible Window Manager. Please refer to wmctrl's homepage for more information.


 TODO:
=======

- keep pydivvy gui always on top (via wmctrl)
- pay attention to window decorations
- use a config file
- clean up code
